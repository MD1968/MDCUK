    <p><br>On 26 February 1999 in Hillside by women’s bureau was when the Idea of MDC created by over 700 people from different background. There were structures created to examine pressing problems in Zimbabwe which at the core were being politically created by Zanu PF party. Challenging Zanu PF politically was an urgent task to resolve the problems. Peace, food and jobs dignity, decency and the right to practise Democracy were some of the main struggles Zimbabweans were struggling with.  MDC was then formed to carry and tackle the struggles people were facing. Key resolutions were adopted and continue to be implemented to guide MDC in a Quest to Address the issues and imbalances created by Zanu PF.<br><br>Seven months later at the Rufaro Stadium in Harare, the working peoples’ convention was held and then gave birth to the political movement known as the MDC.
    
    <h3>Inaugural Congress</h3>
    <p>Chitungwiza Aquatic Complex on 26 January 2000 was when the party had its inaugural congress and Morgan Tsvangirai became the President. Immediately after Zanu PF unleashed political violence and oppression as a political culture that lead to dozens of deaths. This vile political culture is still present and prevalent. After the general election in June 2000 that saw MDC in 57 seats to Zanu PF’s 63, a relentless demonstration of violence was unleashed on the citizens. The party remained steadfast through the challenges despite ZANU Pf rigging the presidential election almost two years later.</p>

    <h3>2005 Parliamentary Election</h3>
    <p>The party participated in the parliamentary election in 2005 despite the violence and intimidation that members were receiving from the Zanu Pf party. The party won 41 seats of the 120 contested seats. Due to external interference that created a different stance between members on the strategic goal of the party, MDC split.</p>

    <h3>2006 Watershed Congress</h3>
    <p>Peaceful and democratic means to end the dictatorship reign of the president were part of substantial resolutions passed at the watershed congress held by MDC in March 2006. The strategy adopted at the congress saw the Zanu PF political monopoly collapse. After Mugabe accepting defeat, he recognised MDC and brought himself to negotiate. In 2008 MDC took control of the parliament and made historical changes that had not been done in 20 years.</p>

    <h3>Coalition Government & the 3rd National Congress</h3>
    <p>Morgan Tsvangirai became the Prime Minister of the Republic of Zimbabwe in 2008 after the negotiations held in 2009. As the head of the government, Zanu PF has since survived through the control of a mere 37 percent of the organs of the state in a coalition.<br><br>In April 2011 the party held its third national congress which saw new people being elected/ chosen into the committee to spearhead on the party ahead of the upcoming election on July 31 2013. After the election that was rigged some committee members walked away raising calls for leadership renewal. The party held their 4th Congress in October 2014 which saw a new leadership board appointed.</p>

    <p>On July 16 2016, President Morgan Tsvangirai appointed Advocate Nelson Chamisa and Engineer Ellias Mudzuri as Vice Presidents. Almost two years after on the 7th of July appointed Nelson Chamisa as the Acting President.</p>
